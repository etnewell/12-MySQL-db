# MySQL Employee Tracker

-Challenges
    -I had to figure out what was happening with my MySQL, it continuously would not allow me to connect, whether I was using my program or other programs I knew would work with it. Once I had that figured out, I felt rather confident in my ability to get the other parts of this done.

# Installation
Install by:
Make sure that node is properly installed, or whatever terminal you happen to use. Navigate to the file containing the index.js file. Run 'npm install' to make sure you have all the right packages. Then run 'node .' to start the application. To initialize the server, copy and paste the code from the emp.sql file into your MySQL database and run it, you should end up with a database with three different tables in it. Run the application.
# Usage
Simply make sure it is installed correctly and run node on the correct file and follow the prompts.

# Tests
No written tests in my code, however if there is something that doesn't seem to be working I would check your inquirer packages to see if they are working.
